Line–Line Intersection

Solve simultaneous equations:
Using determinant method (Cramer’s rule).

\[
a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 = 0
\]  
\[
a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 = 0
\]

Circle–Circle Intersection

Use geometric relations:

𝑑
d = distance between centers

Apply the law of cosines to find intersection chord.

Solve for two intersection points using geometry.
